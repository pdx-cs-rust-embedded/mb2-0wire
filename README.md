# mb2-0wire: "0Wire" RGB LED controller for MicroBit v2.
Bart Massey 2023

This branch demos the use of "high drive" on the NRF52833
pins to supply enough current for the LED. When run, this
program will leave the LED off for 1 second, on with low
drive for 1 second, then on with high drive. This will
result in the LED going from off to orange-yellow to white.
